# Switchboard Phone Web Interface
Primary goal is to use Vagrant to deploy Switchboard Phone Web Interface on CentOS 7 as a means to provide a GUI for a Asterisk based phone system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need some software on your CentOS or Solaris Host Machine, here are the most important:

```
git
Vagrant
Virtualbox
```

### Installalation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

To ease deployment, we have a few handy scripts that will utlize a package manager for each OS to get the pre-requisite software for your host OS.

#### CentOS 7
We will utilize YUM and a few other bash commands to get the Virtualbox, Git,  and Vagrant installed.

YUM
```shell
yum -y install gcc dkms make qt libgomp patch kernel-headers kernel-devel binutils glibc-headers glibc-devel font-forge
cd /etc/yum.repo.d/
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo
yum install -y VirtualBox-5.1
/sbin/rcvboxdrv setup
yum -y install https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.6/vagrant_1.9.6_x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install git
```
